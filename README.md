# HFT-OrderBook
Simple order book in C++ for HFT (High-Frequency Trading).

It is basically an implementation of this repo(https://github.com/Crypto-toolbox/HFT-Orderbook), just in C++. I am doing it as in practice for implementing C++ codes and to get an understanding of creating an order book.

Work under progress, stay tuned!
